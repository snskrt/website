> indriyebhyaḥ parā hy arthā arthebhyaś ca paraṃ manaḥ   
manasas tu parā buddhir buddher ātmā mahān paraḥ ||   
mahataḥ param avyaktam avyaktāt puruṣaḥ paraḥ |   
puruśān na paraṃ kiṃcit sā kāṣṭhā sā parā gatiḥ ||   

The objects of senses are above the senses.   
The mind is above the objects of senses.   
The intellect is above the mind.   
The great Atman is above the intellect.   
The unevolved is above the great Atman.   
The puruṣa is above the unevolved.   
There is nothing above the puruṣa.   
That is the limit, that is the highest state.

The verses are structured around the word **para** (above) used with ablative case (above *something*). 

### Translation Commentary

**indriya** means the sense.   
**artha** means the object of sense.   
**indriyebhyaḥ parā hy arthāḥ** — the objects of senses are above the senses.

**manas** means the mind.   
**arthebhyaś ca paraṃ manaḥ** — the mind is above the objects of senses.

**buddhi** means the intellect.   
**manasas tu parā buddhiḥ** — the intellect is above the mind.

**ātman** could be roughly translated as a ["soul"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%80tman_(Hinduism)). Or rather not be translated at all.   
**mahāt** means "great".   
**buddher ātmā mahān paraḥ** — the great Atman is above the intellect.

**avyakta** means unevolved.   
**mahataḥ param avyaktam** — the unevolved is above the great [Atman].

**kiṃcit** means "something".   
**na** means "not". In this sentence we assume the presense of a verb **asti** (there is). So **na asti** will be translated as "there is no".
