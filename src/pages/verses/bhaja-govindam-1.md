### Translation Commentary

The verb **bhaj** here could be translated as "to worship".   
**bhaj-a** is an imperative form of the verb, which means a command or an advice: you worship.

**govinda** refers to a [name of the god](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Govinda).

**mūḍha-mati** means someone silly(*mūḍha*)-minded(*mati*), or a fool.    
**mūḍha-mate** is a vocative case. Translated as "oh fool".

**samprāpta** is translated as something being reached.   
**samprāpte** is a locative case (in agreement with a word *kāle* below).

**saṃ – nihita** is translated as something being close or near.   
**saṃ – nihite** is a locative case (in agreement with a word *kāle* below).

**kāla** means time. In particular the time of death.   
**kāle** forms *locative absolute* which would be translated as "when the time of death ...".   
In conjunction with *samprāpte* and *sannihite* that would give "when the time of death is close and is reached".   
Or simply "when the death comes".

**rakṣati** comes from the verb root *rakṣ* (to save) and in conjunction with **nahi** is translated as "will not save".
    
**ḍukṛṅkaraṇe** is a quotation from the [Dhatupatha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C4%81%E1%B9%87ini#Dhatupatha) text. The sentence describes the meaning of a verb root *kṛ*, and in this text is used as a metonymy for the grammar in general.
