### Translation Commentary

Suffix *-tva* that is used throughout the text could be interpreted as a "state of ..." or a "fact of ...".   
The syntax of the text is based on **locative absolute**. A word being put into the locative case is interpreted as "when ..." or "when ... takes place".   
That said, we can translate the sentences.

### Line 1

**satsaṅga** comes from the words *sat* (virtuous people) and *saṅga* (contact with).   
**satsaṅga-tva** would be a fact of this contact.   
**satsaṅga-tve** is a locative case: when the fact of contact with virtuous people takes place.   

**nissaṅga** comes from the words *niḥ* (absence of) and *saṅga*. The *saṅga* word is the same as above, yet another meaning of it is "attachment".   
**nissaṅga-tva** would be a fact of non-attachment.   

There is no explicit verb in the sentence, so we assume the verb *asti* (happens, there is).   
The first line in total is: when the fact of contact with virtuous people takes place, [there is] a fact of non-attachment.   
That's too wordy though, so we put it shortly: **from the virtuous company comes the non-attachment**.

### Line 2

**nissaṅga-tve** is a locative form of the word *nissaṅga-tva*, so we translate it as "from the non-attachment".   
**nirmoha** is a combination of *niḥ* (absence of) and *moha* (delusion).   
The whole second line will then be: **from the non-attachment comes the non-delusion**.

### Line 3

**nirmoha-tve** is a locative again, so "from the non-delusion".   
**niścala-tattva** is a combination of *niḥ* (absence of), *cala* (unsteady, fluctuating) and *tattva* (truth). That would be "changeless truth".   
The whole third line will then be: **from the non-delusion comes the changeless truth**.

### Line 4

**niścala-tattve** would mean "from the changeless truth".   
**jīvan-mukti** consists of two words: *jīvat* (being alive) and *mukti* (freedom, liberation, emancipation). In total that would be "emancipation in life"   
**From the changeless truth comes the emancipation in life**
